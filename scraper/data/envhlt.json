Review of several case studies in which industrial operations resulted in discharge of toxic chemicals to air, soils, or surface waters, and subsequently threatened health of adjoining community; this is common scenario for which California's health-protective regulatory process was designed. Through review of response of state and local agencies in these cases, examination of how private interests can influence regulatory decisions, rendering process ineffective in abating health threats, especially in some of California's most vulnerable communities. As practitioners in public health, consideration of how framing of complex regulatory decision in public health terms can be vital to gaining support of policymakers and public.
